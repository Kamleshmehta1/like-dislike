### **Task: Recipe Sharing Platform**

#### **Objective:**

Develop a recipe sharing platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, Node.js) stack. The platform should allow users to create,
share, view, and rate recipes. Users should also be able to search for
recipes based on various criteria.

#### **Requirements:**

1.  Backend:

    - Setup a MongoDB database to store recipes and user data.

    - Create a Node.js and Express.js server to handle API requests.

    - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for recipes and user profiles.

    - Include user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

    - Use Mongoose ORM for MongoDB interactions.

    - Implement validation for recipe input (e.g., title, ingredients, instructions).

2.  Frontend (React.js):

    - Create a React.js frontend for the recipe sharing platform.

    - Display a list of recipes fetched from the backend API.

    - Allow users to create new recipes with a title, ingredients list, cooking instructions, and optional photos.

    - Implement user authentication features such as signup, login, logout, and profile management.

    - Include a search bar to filter recipes based on categories (e.g.,cuisine type, dietary restrictions).

3.  User Interface:

    - Design a visually appealing and intuitive user interface using CSS or a UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI).

    - Display recipes with detailed information, including ingredients, instructions, photos, and ratings.

    - Include features like recipe favoriting, commenting, and sharing.

    - Implement a rating system for users to rate and review recipes.

4.  Additional Features (Optional, for bonus points):

    - Add social sharing capabilities (e.g., sharing recipes on social media platforms).

    - Include a feature to generate shopping lists based on selected recipes.

    - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large recipe collections.

    - Integrate external APIs for recipe data (e.g., fetching recipes from external sources).

#### **Deliverables:**

1.  GitHub Repository:

    - Create a new branch in the Github repository called development and raise a PR to the master branch on completion

    - Include a INSTRUCTIONS.md file with setup instructions, project overview, and any additional information.

2.  Live Demo (Optional but recommended):

    - Deploy the recipe sharing platform to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify) for a live demo.

    - Provide a link to the live demo in the INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**

The MERN stack developer will be evaluated based on the following
criteria:

- Completion of CRUD operations for recipes and user profiles on the backend.

- Functional frontend interface with recipe creation, browsing, and search features.

- Implementation of user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.

- Use of proper error handling, validation, and security measures.

- Optional features and enhancements implemented (if any).

- Deployment quality and documentation completeness (if applicable).
